# NFA to DFA Converter

This Project constitutes a visual tool for converting Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) to Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA). The converter allows users to build an NFA visually and then perform the conversion process step-by-step or in animated/complete modes.

## Description

This web-based converter offers an intuitive interface to construct and convert NFAs into DFAs. The HTML file contains:

- Canvas for NFA and DFA representations
- Instructions on how to use the NFA builder and DFA converter
- Options to import saved NFA JSON files or use predefined example NFAs
- Controls to perform conversions step-by-step, animate the conversion process, or complete it at once
- Reset functionalities for both NFA and DFA

## Features

### NFA Builder
- **Node Creation**: Right-click on the canvas to create nodes representing states.
- **Transitions**: Create transitions between nodes by right-clicking on them.
- **Canvas Interaction**: Pan the canvas by clicking and dragging; zoom in/out using the mouse scroll.

### DFA Converter
- **Conversion Modes**: Perform conversions stepwise, in animation, or completely.
- **Navigation**: Move forward/backward in the conversion process.
- **Visual Representation**: Display the DFA graphically based on the converted NFA.

## How to Use

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Use the NFA Builder section to construct your NFA by creating nodes and defining transitions.
3. Utilize the controls in the DFA Converter section to convert the NFA into a DFA.
4. Follow the instructions provided within the interface to navigate and understand the conversion process.

## Dependencies

This HTML file utilizes:
- Bulma CSS framework for styling
- Material Design Icons for graphical elements
- JavaScript (index.js) for interactive functionalities

## Usage

1. Clone/download the repository containing this HTML file.
2. Open the HTML file in a compatible web browser.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to build and convert NFAs.
