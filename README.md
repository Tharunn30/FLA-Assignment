It takes input from the user.

This is the sample input for the code:

No. of states : 4

No. of transitions : 2

state name : A

path : a

Enter end state from state traveling through path a:
A B

path : b

Enter end state from state A traveling through path b:
A

state name : B

path : a

Enter end state from state B travelling through path a:
C

path : b

Enter end state from state B travelling through path b:
C

state name : C

path : a

Enter end state from state C while traveling through path a:
D

path : b

Enter end state from state C travelling through path b : 
D

state name : D

path : a

Enter end state from state D travelling through path a : 


path : b

Enter end state from state D travelling through path b :
